# CLAUDE.md - RiteMark Native

## Project Identity

RiteMark Native is a VS Code OSS fork with RiteMark built-in as the native markdown editor. This is a standalone branded app, **not an extension**.

**Target:** Local-first markdown editing with offline support.

---

## Architecture (Locked Decisions)

| Component | Choice | Non-Negotiable |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| VS Code OSS | Git submodule | NOT a fork - easy upstream sync |
| Integration | Custom Editor Provider | .md files open in RiteMark webview |
| Build target | darwin-arm64 | Apple Silicon |
| Marketplace | Hidden | Prevent extension conflicts |
| Telemetry | Minimal, opt-out | Privacy first |

## VS Code Patch System

We customize VS Code via **patch files** (not direct submodule edits). This allows easy upstream updates.

### Patch Workflow

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Apply all patches | `./scripts/apply-patches.sh` |
| Check patch status | `./scripts/apply-patches.sh --dry-run` |
| Create new patch | `./scripts/create-patch.sh "name"` |
| Update VS Code | `./scripts/update-vscode.sh` |
| Remove patches | `./scripts/apply-patches.sh --reverse` |

### Rules

1. **Never edit vscode/ directly** without creating a patch
2. **All VS Code customizations** must be saved as patch files in `patches/vscode/`
3. **After fresh clone**: Run `./scripts/apply-patches.sh`
4. **Before updating VS Code**: Run `./scripts/update-vscode.sh --check` to test

### Current Patches

| Patch | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `001-terminal-default-to-right-sidebar.patch` | Terminal opens in right sidebar by default |

---

## Critical Invariants

These MUST always be true. If broken, the project won't work:

| Invariant | Check | If Broken |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Extension symlink | `ls -la vscode/extensions/ritemark` shows `→ ../../extensions/ritemark` | Invoke `vscode-expert` |
| Webview bundle | `media/webview.js` is ~900KB (not 64KB) | Invoke `webview-expert` |
| Node architecture | `node -p "process.arch"` shows `arm64` | Invoke `vscode-expert` |
| Patches applied | `./scripts/apply-patches.sh --dry-run` shows all "Already applied" | Run `./scripts/apply-patches.sh` |

---

## Team

- **Jarmo** = Product Owner (decisions, testing, approval)
- **Claude** = Engineering (via expert agents below)

**When uncertain → Ask Jarmo**

---

## Expert Agents (MANDATORY Invocation)

I do NOT contain detailed technical knowledge in this file.
I MUST delegate to the appropriate expert agent.

| Domain | Agent | Trigger Keywords |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Builds, Extensions, Errors, Patches | `vscode-expert` | build, compile, error, fail, not working, extension, patch, update vscode |
| Sprint Workflow | `sprint-manager` | sprint, phase, plan, implement, feature |
| Quality Gates | `qa-validator` | commit, push, done, merge, PR |
| Releases & Distribution | `release-manager` | release, publish, ship, deploy, dmg, notarization, github release |
| Webview/Editor | `webview-expert` | webview, tiptap, react, vite, bundle, editor |
| Marketing & Content | `product-marketer` | changelog, release notes, blog post, landing page, marketing |

### Invocation Rule

When user input contains trigger keywords → **INVOKE agent BEFORE responding.**

Responding without invoking the required agent is a **VIOLATION** of project governance.

---

## Approval Gates (HARD Enforcement)

| Gate | Condition | Release Phrase |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Sprint Phase 2→3 | Cannot write implementation code | "approved", "Jarmo approved", "proceed" |
| Any commit | qa-validator must pass all checks | All checks green |
| Production release | release-manager Gate 1 (technical) + Gate 2 (Jarmo tested) | "tested locally", "approved for release" |

**These gates cannot be bypassed.** If blocked, wait for approval or fix issues.

---

## Self-Check Protocol

Before EVERY response, I ask myself:

1. **Domain check:** Does this touch a domain in the expert table?
   - Yes → Have I invoked the required agent?
   - No agent invoked → **STOP. Invoke agent first.**

2. **Gate check:** Am I in a sprint? What phase?
   - Phase 2 without approval → **Cannot write code. Request approval.**
   - Ready to commit → **Invoke qa-validator first.**

3. **Uncertainty check:** Am I unsure about the right approach?
   - Yes → **Ask Jarmo before proceeding.**

| Build production | `vscode-expert` |
| Fix blank editor | `webview-expert` |
| Start new sprint | `sprint-manager` |
| Commit changes | `qa-validator` |
| Fix build error | `vscode-expert` |
| Apply/create patches | `vscode-expert` |
| Update VS Code upstream | `vscode-expert` |
| Release to GitHub | `release-manager` |
| Check notarization | `release-manager` |
| Create DMG | `release-manager` |
